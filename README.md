# 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction (Beginner AI Project)

This project is part of my AI learning journey, where I'm building hands-on projects to deeply understand machine learning concepts through practice.

---

## 📘 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on features like their class, age, fare, gender, boarding port, and family presence.

---

## 🧠 What I Learned

- How to work with real-world tabular data using `pandas`
- Data cleaning and handling missing values
- Encoding categorical features like `Sex` and `Embarked`
- Creating new features: `FamilySize` and `IsAlone`
- Training classification models using `RandomForestClassifier` and `LogisticRegression`
- Evaluating model accuracy and understanding feature importance

---

## 📊 Accuracy Results

| Model | Accuracy |
|-------|----------|
| Random Forest | 82% |
| Logistic Regression | 81% |

## 📁 Files Included

- `titanic_model.ipynb`: Google Colab notebook with all code and steps
- `README.md`: Project summary and learning outcomes

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

- Python
- pandas, numpy, matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- Google Colab

---

## 📌 Next Steps

- Try more advanced models like `XGBoost` or `SVM`
- Tune hyperparameters using `GridSearchCV`
- Explore precision, recall, and F1-score
- Deploy this model using Streamlit (optional)
